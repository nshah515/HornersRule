# HornersRule


Horner: Given the coefficients of a polynomial a0, a1, . . . an, and a real
number x0, find P(x0) and P'(x0).

Sample input representing P(x) = 2 + 3x âˆ’ x^2 + 2x^3 , x0 = 3.5:

3.5
the first number is the degree of the polynomial, the coefficients are in the
order a0, a1, . . . , an, the last number is x0.
